Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2024. This repository contains my solutions to the programming challenges provided during the event. Each day's challenge is solved with my current understanding and skills in programming.

## Disclaimer
-  **Probably Not Optimal...**: The solutions here may not be the most optimal, I'm just having fun lol.

## Summary
Each day's folder has a detailed explanation of my approach.

|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
